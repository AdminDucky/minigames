# minigames
This is my small repository for making &amp; learning how to do minigames in python, I am often using tutorials for there

# Information
Hello, my name is AdminDucky! I am a small, beginning developer in Python. As of the time of writing this, I still have quite a lot to learn, and I can only write the most simple and basic programs one could write. As my goal, I wish to become a discord bot developer at some point, or maybe also make some small minigames? Anyway, thanks for looking by!

#  List
- [x] Ping Pong using `turtle`
- [ ] 4 wins
- [ ] mini tetris
- [ ] own project

# Closing
As I still am a beginning developer, I am accepting and am very greatful about any critique or suggestions I might get, thus the public repository. If submitting critique, please make it constructive and explain in a beginner-friendly way.

Thank you!
With regards,
*AdminDucky*
